# Lending-Club-Project
A model to predict whether or not a borrower will pay back the loan, given historical data on loans given out with information whether the borrower defaulted.

The dataset used here is from Kaggle, however a little edited- to perform some data preprocessing.

Compiled the model with 3 hidden layers, 1 input and 1 ouput layer.
Have performed the same process with and without early stop.
Better to try with a reduced batch size- however might take a longer time.
Epochs can be increased to around 600, also the patience to 40/50. - Should result in a better prediction.
